make two general varibales for each color and use them to caculate the movement than pass the value to the array of that color
write general conditions which would determie the movement on the board
maybe only two varilables would do the work instead of each and every color hs his own seprate two variable
try to implement the conditions on these two varibles that would help to re-use the code.
movement of a single would make all other gotis an easy task.
all other condition of killing and jota would be easy to compare once the movement on the track is done.
